# tictactoe
Tic-Tac-Toe game app!

This app allows the user to play Tic Tac Toe with other players through a Web Service communcating via JSON.
It gives the user the ability to create a game by typing in their name, or to join an existing game by typing in their name and the ID of the game he wishes to join.
It tells the user(s) who won the round (or if its a draw), and keeps score of how many times each player has won. 
It allows users to play again...and again, updating the score when players press Reset, which is made available when a round is over.

Home screen where user can choose to Create a game or join a game
